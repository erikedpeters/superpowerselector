==================
This Super Hero Generator uses the HTML5 canvas element to display data and read input.

Due to a delay in loading and immediate drawibility of images, there is a short delay before 
the canvas populates with the information from the superpower JSON.

The script is set up to read from any modified JSON where each object has power, description, 
caveats, nemesis, and image keys. There was a technical omission for varied nemesis values on the 
results screen, namely that the comparison between values only extends to the previous value.

Canvas allows for mobile devices to fairly easily maneuver the page, substituting clicks for 
taps.
